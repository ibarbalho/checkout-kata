### Tasks:
* Implement a supermarket checkout system that calculates the total price of a set of scanned items.
* Each item has a unit price, which may change frequently.
* Some items include special offers (e.g., "3 for 130").
* The checkout accepts items in any order and still applies valid discounts.

If a customer scans an Apple, a Banana, and another Apple, the system should recognize two Apples and apply the discount 2 for 45.
